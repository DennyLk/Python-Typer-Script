# Human-Like Typing Application

A Python application that reads text from text files and displays it with a human-like typing effect. This application can be run using a Bash script, which can be activated through keyboard shortcuts for quick access.

## Project Overview

The **Human-Like Typing Application** is a utility designed to mimic human typing when displaying text. It reads content from specified text files and types out the text character-by-character with slight delays, simulating a human typing on a keyboard. The application is intended to be activated quickly via a Bash script and a user-defined keyboard shortcut.

### Key Features

- **Human-Like Typing**: Types out text from files with a delay between characters to simulate human typing.
- **Shortcut-Activated**: The application can be launched using custom keyboard shortcuts, making it quick and easy to start.
- **File-Based Input**: Reads from text files, allowing for easy customization of the text content.
- **Bash Script Integration**: The application is run through a Bash script, streamlining the process of launching the typing script.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a Python script for typing text, text files containing the content to be typed, and a Bash script to execute the Python script.
